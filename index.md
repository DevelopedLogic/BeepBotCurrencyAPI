# Welcome to the API documentation
## This documentation will assist you in using the HTTPS API provided by BeepBot for managing user and wallet currency.
#### It is important to note that the API is the only method of transferring currency FROM wallets, and the Discord bot is the only way of transferring currency FROM personal UUID based balances. You may transfer between both UUID based balances and wallets, as they are all compatible with each other.
#### Users are allowed one UUID based balance. This is a type of wallet which is attached to your Discord Developer's ID, which does not change if your username or user ID number changes. Users may also have additional UUID based balances for alternate accounts, without limit.
#### Users are allowed unlimited API wallets. These wallets can be viewed and transferred to using the Discord Bot or using the API, but may only be withdrawn from using the API. This is because wallets are password protected with the password stored in the database in a hash (however the password is sent to the server to be hashed and checked in plain text, hence why the API can only be accessed using SSL enabled HTTPS, so that your plain text password is only plain text to both you and the API server, and nobody else.)
